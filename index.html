                            During the final year of my degree, I took part in the AUT R&D program. This
                            is a one-year course where teams of students work with clients from outside
                            of the university to create software for them. I led my team in a very
                            successful project that left our client very happy and impressed the university
                            faculty. The software was created to help dentists read and write their dental
                            records as current software provides poor user experiences. It involved the
                            creation of a Customer Relationship Management system and linking its
                            database to a medical information page containing a 3D dynamic model
                            representing the patients’ teeth and treatments applied to them.
